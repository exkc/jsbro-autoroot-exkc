# jsbro / jsbro-autoroot

Browser-assisted root exploit chain for LG webOS TVs.

**[Use it → raws0kil.github.io/jsbro-autoroot](https://raws0kil.github.io/jsbro-autoroot/)**

## How it works

1. Enter your TV's local IP in the web UI
2. Accept the SSAP pairing prompt on the TV
3. jsbro launches the `dangbei-overlay` app via SSAP, which downloads a root-persistence script and uses the `jsserver` service to execute it as root
4. The script installs [Homebrew Channel](https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel) and removes the Developer Mode app if present
5. A dialog on the TV shows the result—on success, reboot to activate persistent root

jsbro requires the `dangbei-overlay` app (present on most webOS 7+ firmwares). The tool checks for its existence automatically.

## Prerequisites

- LG webOS TV reachable on your LAN
- Browser that supports WebSockets (Chrome recommended — self-signed cert acceptance required)

## Supported webOS

**WebOS 7.x up to WebOS 25**

Requires the `dangbei-overlay` app, which is present on most webOS 7+ firmwares. The tool checks for this automatically.

If you are unsure if it's applicable for you, it can be tested without risk.

## Troubleshooting

**Windows Launcher**
If you have problems with connecting to the TV due to certificate error you can start chrome without certificate checks.
Run this command within a PowerShell:

```pwsh
Start-Process "$env:ProgramFiles\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" -ArgumentList @(
  "--user-data-dir=$env:TEMP\chrome-jsbro-insecure",
  "--no-first-run",
  "--ignore-certificate-errors",
  "--allow-running-insecure-content",
  "--disable-web-security",
  "--new-window",
  "https://raws0kil.github.io/jsbro-autoroot"
)
```

- **Nothing happens on TV after launch**: the `dangbei-overlay` app may not exist on your firmware. Check whether the service is present / other rooting options.
- **Root setup failed**: check `/tmp/jsbro-root.log` on the TV.
- **Rooting complete but no Homebrew Channel**: reboot the TV. Make sure **Quick Start+** is disabled (`Settings → General → Quick Start+`).
- **IPK install error (errorCode -5)**: the TV's date/time is too far off. Correct it and retry.
- **Certificate blocked / WSS fails instantly**: open `https://<TV-IP>:3001/` in your browser first and accept the self-signed certificate.
